This is java programming to access, use, edit and store data in database.
In this process we have used:
A). For Backend:-
1. Java(jdk-version 17)
2. SpringBoot (dependencies: spring web, jdbc, 
3. Intellij IDE
4. Postman
5. Xampp(Apache+MySql+Tomacat)
6. Postman

B). For Frontend:-
1. React.js framework
2. JavaScript
3. Vscode
Here We'll be seeing the basic to moderate coding techniques.
The first branch (main) shows basic concept for backend beginner developer.
Here all the basic packages are setup
Similarly in each brach controller and working in packages are done
Uding reactjs framework, the basic interface is developed just to see the connection and working.

The main aim of this process are:
to check whether the database connected to backend and working fine or not.
to see and check whether the data inserted in frontend is stored in database.
to see how frontend and backend part communicate with each other and communicating with db is the main thing here.
